Question_id has the form 'OGE_SKILLS_m_n_k', where m is number of skill from our table of skills; n is the difficulty level from our definition of difficulty levels; k is the number of problem for the given m and n.

In the csv we have 540 problems of which 2/3 were generated by Claude Haiku and 1/3 were generated by ChatGPT o4 mini. You can see in the "source" column the origin of the problem.

I did not ask LLM to define skills for each step since these problems are designed to cover specific skill after all.

I did not separate each Step to individual column.

I did not ask LLM to define "code" from OGE codificator, since we will have a table with correspondance between skills and codes. So we will do it automatically when this correspondance is defined.
